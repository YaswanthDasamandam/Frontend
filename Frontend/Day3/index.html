        <p>I struggled to find an internship but, after almost 600 applications, managed to secure one in a wonderful company. And now, almost 2000+ applications later, I still HOPE that something will turn up in my email for a full-time job. It's a scary situation; every day is a panic, but every day is a hustle. Leetcode, applications, asking for referrals, reaching out to as many people as possible, and learning a new tech skill one after another has been the process for the last 6 months as I hunt for a job. But I won't give up; my resilience will bring me back again and again. I've heard stories about LinkedIn posts creating magic sometimes, so here it goes.Dear recruiters and hiring managers, above are all the strengths you will be looking for in a candidate: determination, perseverance, and a never-give-up attitude. Along with soft skills, technically I have experience in full-stack development for almost 2 years. Right from creating websites to designing databases, developing APIs to working in cybersecurity, I have an all-rounder profile. I am graduating in May 2024, in 10 days, and am open to work immediately. I am seeking new grad or mid-level roles in full stack, backend, frontend, and data engineering roles which would accept 1-2 years of software development experience, but I am confident I can bring more to the table.Please find my portfolio and resume link in the comments.</p>
